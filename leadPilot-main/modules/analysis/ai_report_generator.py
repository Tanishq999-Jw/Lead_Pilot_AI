- Do not assume anything that is not present in the input.
- If a check was not performed, mark it as "Not verified".
- Do not insult the business or say the website is bad.
- Use soft professional language like "could improve", "may be missing", "there appears to be".
- Focus on how the business can get more inquiries, bookings, trust, visibility, conversions, and automation.

Input data will include:
- business details
- website presence
- audit scores
- SEO findings
- CTA findings
- speed findings
- security findings
- broken link findings
- trust signals
- app requirement signals
- rule-based pain points
